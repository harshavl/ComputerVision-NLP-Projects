# Object Detector using template match
This is simple and practically effortless object detector.And, not works for all conditions.
This uses derivation of the correlation coefficient.

Drawbacks:
Not support for multiscale template matching.
It depends on intensity of the pixels instead of feature vectors or abstract representaion of the image.
